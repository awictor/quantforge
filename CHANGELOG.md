## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-09

First stable release. The public API is now considered stable under SemVer.

### Added
- Single-sourced version: `pyproject.toml` reads `quantforge.__version__`.

### Summary of the 1.0 feature set
- **Pricing** — generalized Black-Scholes-Merton (stock, dividend, Black-76,
  FX via cost-of-carry `b`); European and American exercise.
- **Greeks** — analytic delta, gamma, vega, theta, rho, plus the second-order
  vanna, vomma/volga, charm, veta, speed, zomma, color.
- **Implied volatility** — robust Newton-with-bisection solver with
  arbitrage-band rejection.
- **American options** — Cox-Ross-Rubinstein binomial tree and the
  Bjerksund-Stensland (2002) closed form (~500x faster than the tree).
- **Exotics** — cash/asset-or-nothing digitals, single-barrier options
  (Reiner-Rubinstein, all four kinds, with rebate), geometric-Asian.
- **Volatility surfaces** — Gatheral raw SVI and SABR (Hagan expansion), each
  with calibration.
- **Monte Carlo** — GBM engine with antithetic and control-variate variance
  reduction; standard errors on every estimate.
- **Portfolio** — batch pricing, net Greeks, VaR / Expected Shortfall
  (parametric delta-gamma, historical, full-reprice MC), spot×vol stress grid.
- **Realized volatility** — close-to-close, EWMA, Parkinson, Garman-Klass,
  Rogers-Satchell, Yang-Zhang estimators.
- **Performance** — zero-dependency core (~1.4M prices/sec) with an optional
  NumPy vectorized fast path (~6x on large batches).
- **Tooling** — 182 tests, CI on Python 3.8/3.10/3.12, tag-triggered PyPI
  release via Trusted Publishing, reproducible benchmark suite.

## [0.1.0 - 0.13.0]

Pre-1.0 development. Each minor version added one major capability area:
BSM core (0.1), portfolio/CLI/CI (0.2), SVI surface (0.3), exotics (0.4),
Monte Carlo (0.5), VaR/ES (0.6), realized vol (0.7), second-order Greeks and
the release workflow (0.8), benchmarks (0.9), the NumPy fast path (0.10), the
stress grid (0.11), Bjerksund-Stensland American (0.12), and SABR (0.13).
